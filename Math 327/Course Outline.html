<p><span> </span></p>
<h2>Course Outline, Winter 2019</h2>
<p><span> </span><span></span><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinates</strong>:<br />Times/Location: Tue, Thu, 5:35pm-6:55pm in BURN 306,&nbsp;starting&nbsp;Tuesday 8th January, 2019<br />Instructor: Ivo Panayotov, E-mail: <span>ivo.panayotov@mcgill.ca</span><br />Office Hours:&nbsp;Tue, Thu, 7:00-8:00pm after class or&nbsp;by appointment<br /><span></span></li>
<li><strong>Description</strong><br />This is a first course on matrix numerical analysis. We will consider the main basic problems of linear systems including under and over determined problems, and eigenvalue problems and the main direct and iterative methods to solve them. Derivation and analysis of the algorithms will be an essential part of the course. Does the algorithm give the exact answer? If not, is the error small, and in what sense? We will use matlab to implement some of these algorithms and experiment with others. <span></span></li>
<li><strong>Syllabus</strong><br />An overview of numerical methods for linear algebra applications and their analysis. Problem classes include linear systems, least squares problems and eigenvalue problems. <span></span></li>
<li><strong>Topics</strong><br />Topics to be covered, subject to time constraints, and maybe not in this order are <span></span></li>
<li>Basics : Matrices, vectors, norms, orthogonality.</li>
<li>Orthogonal Factorizations: QR, Gram-Schmidt procedure, Householder triangularization, SVD.</li>
<li>Least Squares Problems: set-up, normal equations, applications.</li>
<li>Linear Systems: Gaussian elimination, LU factorization, pivoting, Cholesky</li>
<li>Eigenvalue problems: properties of eigenvalues, power method, inverse iteration, Rayleigh quotient, QR iteration</li>
<li>Iterative Methods: Arnoldi, GMRES, Lanczos, Conjugate-Gradient Method</li>
<li><strong>Differences in the Courses</strong><br />Math327 is intended primarily for students in majors programs. Math397 is intended for students in Honours programs. The courses share the same lectures, but the assignments, midterm and final exam for the two courses will be different. Honours students should expect some analytical questions. <span></span></li>

<li><strong>Prerequisites: </strong><br />The course is intended for all students with an interest in matrix numerical analysis. The class will combine theory and practice, with the emphasis towards theory. Nevertheless we will also use matlab to perform computations. <span>The prerequisites are<br />MATH 223 or MATH 236 or MATH 247 or MATH 251,<br />and<br />COMP 202<br />or<br />consent of instructor.</span> <span>Familiarity with matlab would also be useful. Information on matlab&nbsp;will be given on&nbsp;MyCourses</span></li>
<li><strong>Assignments:</strong><br />There will be regular assignments. These will count for 20% of the final mark.</li>
</ul>
<p><span> </span><span></span><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Midterm:</strong><br />There will be an in-class (or room-booked) midterm worth 30% of the final mark.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span> </span><span></span><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Final Exam:</strong><br />There will be a formal 3 hour final exam which will count 50% of the final mark. <span></span></li>
<li><strong>Policies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>No make up tests will be given.</li>
<li>No late homework will be accepted under any circumstances, except for an absence approved <em>in advance</em> by the instructor.</li>
<li>Important announcements (including posting of assignments and due dates) will be made in class and to registered students by e-mail (via MyCourses to your official McGill e-mail address) and/or posted on <strong>MyCourses</strong>. You are responsible for reading your McGill e-mail.</li>
<li>I attempt to reply to e-mail in a timely fashion, but do not expect immediate responses. I usually will not reply to email sent the day before a test.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Academic Integrity</strong> <br />The work you hand in should be your own effort; any collaboration must be acknowledged. <span>McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see <span>www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/</span> for more information).<br /></span></li>
