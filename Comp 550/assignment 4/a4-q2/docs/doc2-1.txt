Fortnite will host an in-game Winter Royale tournament this week that features a total of $1 million in prizes across North America and Europe. Epic Games revealed the news in a tournament-focused blog post Tuesday morning.
In preparation for the first-ever Fortnite World Cup event next year, the Winter Royale Tournament essentially acts as a test for the online systems that will be used to determine participants in that major showcase. Just like every in-game tournament since ladders debuted last month, everyone is eligible to enter. Players with the highest scores at the end of the qualifier period advance to the finals.
Specific times will likely be revealed closer to the Qualifiers start date.
This news was revealed as part of larger blog post focused on recent changes being made to Fortniteâ€™s tournament system. As of Fortnite Update 6.30, which released last week, point totals are now factored into matchmaking, and bugs with point calculation have been addressed. Short-term Pop-Up Cups are also coming soon as well, which essentially act as tournaments for LTMs. More info on those will become available in the events tab as they happen.
In the absence of a true Winter Skirmish, it appears Winter Royale will take the fight to the public. Only the very best Fortnite players will actually win prize money for their efforts, but at least everyone has a chance to fight for ultimate glory. Similar open in-game tournaments have been critical to establishing esports scenes for everything from Call of Duty to Clash Royale.
Fortnite is available now on PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC and mobile.
