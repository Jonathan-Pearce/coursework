Fall Skirmish may be behind us, but Epic Games has announced a new 'Winter Royale' Open Tournament beginning this month. The developer has staked $1,000,000 in prize money for the winter games and anyone can qualify to be a part of them.
"There will be several chances for anyone to try and get a high score during the Winter Royale Qualifier days" writes Epic in a blog post. "The highest score you achieve during any event session will be the one that counts, so be sure to give it your all!"
Alongside the Winter Royale Qualifiers, Pop-Up Cups will be held which you can find in the in-game Events tab. These Cups will be short tournaments with varying rules, similar to competitive Limited Time Modes. "Think of these as the equivalent of Competitive LTMs where we can test large adjustments in a more competitive environment," Epic writes.
The Winter Royale matches will use the same game settings as the current Pop-Up Cup. The highest scoring players from the qualifying rounds will then move on to the Winter Royale Finals. Remember, it's only your highest score during an event session that matters.
For specific times of all these tournaments, Epic directs us to the in-game Events tab. You can read more about the Winter Royale Tournaments here.
I'm glad to see Epic Games focusing more on competitive play as it's been something of a mixed bag up to this point. The game, at least in its natural state, isn't terribly well cut-out for big streaming tournaments and we've seen plenty of fails along the way. That being said, I think there's plenty of ways this game could work as an eSport and in competitive tournaments like this one, and I'm always happy to see qualifying rounds open to the general public. The best players aren't always the famous ones, after all.
