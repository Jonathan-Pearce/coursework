For the InSight lander, it's Sol One on Mars as the vehicle is ready to begin surface operations. "It's been a long day for the team," Tom Hoffman, InSight's project manager at JPL, said last night. "But tomorrow begins an exciting new chapter for InSight: surface operations and the beginning of the instrument deployment phase."
There may have been cheers yesterday as the InSight lander set down on Mars, but a major milestone remained unchecked even as the celebrations began. Though not as dramatic, the deployment of the craft's solar panels is as vital a milestone as touchdown
At 8:30 EST the spacecraft sent a signal to the Odyssey orbiter, which relayed it to the eager mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena and at Lockheed Martin's control room outside Denver. The signal confirmed what everyone wanted to hearâ€”the two 7-foot-wide panels were open and the batteries recharging.
"The InSight team can rest a little easier tonight now that we know the spacecraft solar arrays are deployed and recharging the batteries," said Hoffman after hearing the signal.
The panels provide as much as 700 watts on a clear day. That output can be more than halved by dust storms. This is about a blender's worth of power that will be dedicated to running the lander's scientific instruments. That includes a seismographic sensors, a subsurface temperature probe, an experiment to measure the planet's wobble, and a robotic arm to deploy them.
The mission is expected to last for two years, during which scientists will get a thorough picture of the the Martian interior and plumb clues to the origin of the planet.
