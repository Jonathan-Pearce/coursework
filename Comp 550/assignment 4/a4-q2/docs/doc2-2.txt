Fortnite’s Fall Skirmish has come to an end, and while the event started out strong, it slowed down a bit near the end. Thankfully, Epic Games is revisiting the game’s tournament structure and this time, everyone will have a chance to get in on the competition.
The next tournament will be the Winter Royale, which will be hosted through Fortnite’s in-game tournament system. The Winter Royale will consist of two different stages, the qualifiers and the Finals, and will be a solo event meaning every player will be competing on their own. Just like previous in-game tournaments, the Winter Royale qualifiers will throw players into lobbies with other players competing in the tournament, and grant points for things like high finishes and eliminations. The players who have the highest points at the end of the qualifiers will then have a chance to compete in the Finals for a part of the tournament’s $1 million prize pool.
There’s no word yet on just how many players will compete in the Finals, whether there will be just one lobby of 100 players for Europe and one lobby for North America, or if there will be several lobbies that will steadily get narrowed down.
The Winter Royale is being used, in part, as a test run for Epic’s upcoming Fortnite World Cup, which should start sometime next year. The World Cup will also use the in-game tournament system and will likely feature a similar point structure and format to the Winter Royale.
The Winter Royale open qualifiers will be held on Nov. 24 and 25. The European Finals will be held on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, while North America’s will be from Dec. 11 to Dec. 12. The Winter Royale will only be available in these two regions. However, Epic said it plans on creating other tournaments for other regions, both for the players to compete in and as a test of its tournament system in those regions as well.
