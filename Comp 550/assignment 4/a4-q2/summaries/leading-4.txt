At 194 centimetres high, WA-born steer Knickers is believed to be the tallest in Australia  and one of the tallest in the world. To put it into perspective, the seven-year-old is almost as tall as NBA star Michael Jordan and weighs more than a Mini Cooper car at about 1,400 kilograms. That's double the weight of the average Holstein Friesian and half a metre taller  and could make more than 4,000 hamburger lovers happy. But owner Geoff Pearson of Lake Preston in the state's south-west said Knickers was not destined for the barbecue anytime soon. "He was too big to go into the export plant's chain," Mr Pearson said of the beast's near-miss at the abattoir.
