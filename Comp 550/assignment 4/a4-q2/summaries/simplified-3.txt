For the InSight lander, it's Sol One on Mars as the vehicle is ready to begin surface operations. NASA's InSight lander has made it to Mars, but it'll be a while before the robot is ready to start its science work. Then they'll practice deployment using a testbed lander here at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which manages InSight's mission. "It's been a long day for the team," Tom Hoffman, InSight's project manager at JPL, said last night. Once InSights instruments are in place, the landers science mission can begin in earnest. It'll take two to three months to finish the deployments, Barrett said, "and then another couple of months" before InSight's ready to begin its Mars science campaign in earnest.
