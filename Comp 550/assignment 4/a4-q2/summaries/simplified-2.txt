You can read more about the Winter Royale Tournaments here. The next tournament will be the Winter Royale, which will be hosted through Fortnites in-game tournament system. Just like previous in-game tournaments, the Winter Royale qualifiers will throw players into lobbies with other players competing in the tournament, and grant points for things like high finishes and eliminations. What are your thoughts on this open tournament format? The World Cup will also use the in-game tournament system and will likely feature a similar point structure and format to the Winter Royale. For specific times of all these tournaments, Epic directs us to the in-game Events tab.
