For the InSight lander, it's Sol One on Mars as the vehicle is ready to begin surface operations. This probe will measure how much heat is coming from deep within the planet. Once InSights instruments are in place, the landers science mission can begin in earnest. We have a test bed here that well actually terraform to look very much like the Martian area we land in, and well practice deploying to make sure everything is going to go smoothly, Barrett said. But the team at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, will have time to rehearse. It'll take two to three months to finish the deployments, Barrett said, "and then another couple of months" before InSight's ready to begin its Mars science campaign in earnest.
