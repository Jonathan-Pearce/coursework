No, Knickers is not a cow. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the tallest living steer is a Chianina named Bellino, who stands about 6 feet, 7 inches tall. He was bought for $400 to live as a coach among the other cattle, showing them how to live on a farm. "He was too big to go into the export plant's chain," Mr Pearson said of the beast's near-miss at the abattoir. Eenennaam also pointed out that there are taller and heavier breeds than Holsteins, like Chianina which is both the tallest and the heaviest breed of cattle, she wrote.
