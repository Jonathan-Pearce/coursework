No, Knickers is not a cow. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the tallest living steer is a Chianina named Bellino, who stands about 6 feet, 7 inches tall. "He was too big to go into the export plant's chain," Mr Pearson said of the beast's near-miss at the abattoir. He was bought for $400 to live as a coach among the other cattle, showing them how to live on a farm. It was too heavy. "Obviously the bulls and the steers are also going to grow larger as we select larger genetics." The very big boy is a Holstein Friesian, a breed that originated in North Holland and Northern Germany that humans have been breeding for dairy production over the last 2,000 years.
