If that game is drawn, black will be declared the winner. In this chess game type, there will be a winner - a draw means a victory for the player wielding the black game pieces. If it is still a draw after that, two "blitz" games are played - with just five minutes per player and three added seconds per turn. In the ordinary games, each player starts with a generous time bank of 100 minutes, and more time is added as the game progresses. The tie-breaker will be a series of increasingly fast games. After 12 games and 12 draws, American Fabiano Caruana is seeking to take the title from Norwegian Magnus Carlsen.
