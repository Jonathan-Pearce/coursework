Fortnite will host an in-game Winter Royale tournament this week that features a total of $1 million in prizes across North America and Europe. Epic Games revealed the news in a tournament-focused blog post Tuesday morning. In preparation for the first-ever Fortnite World Cup event next year, the Winter Royale Tournament essentially acts as a test for the online systems that will be used to determine participants in that major showcase. Just like every in-game tournament since ladders debuted last month, everyone is eligible to enter. Players with the highest scores at the end of the qualifier period advance to the finals.
