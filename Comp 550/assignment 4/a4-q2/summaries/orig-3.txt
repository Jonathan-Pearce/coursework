For the InSight lander, it's Sol One on Mars as the vehicle is ready to begin surface operations. It'll probably take the lander about that long to gather enough data to address its main mission goals, team members have said. Over the next two to three months, Barrett and her team will direct the landers six-foot-long robotic arm to pluck each science instrument from the craft and place it directly on the Martian surface. This probe will measure how much heat is coming from deep within the planet. Then they'll practice deployment using a testbed lander here at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which manages InSight's mission.
