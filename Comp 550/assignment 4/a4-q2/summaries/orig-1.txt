If that game is drawn, black will be declared the winner. But chess legend Garry Kasparov said he was losing faith in Carlsen. They will try to settle things first in a four-game series in which each player will have 25 minutes. If he wins, Caruana will be the first US world champion since Bobby Fischer in 1972. If it is still a draw after that, two "blitz" games are played - with just five minutes per player and three added seconds per turn. "I think I have very good chances," the Norwegian told reporters after Monday's game. An extra 10 seconds of time are added for each move they make.
