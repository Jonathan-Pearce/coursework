The big chess showdown between three-time defending champion Magnus Carlsen and his US challenger Fabiano Caruana will be decided by a series of rapid-play tiebreakers on Wednesday. Norway's Carlsen and Caruana wrapped up their 12-match World Chess Championship series in London with their 12th successive draw on Monday. It was an anti-climactic finish to a showdown between 27-year old Carlsen -- a former child prodigy now regarded by many as the greatest ever chess player -- and the first American contender to the crown since the legendary Bobby Fischer in 1972. The result means the players will have a day off on Tuesday before getting together for an intense session of chess played in a completely different format.
