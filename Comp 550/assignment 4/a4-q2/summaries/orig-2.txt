You can read more about the Winter Royale Tournaments here. Players with the highest scores at the end of the qualifier period advance to the finals. For specific times of all these tournaments, Epic directs us to the in-game Events tab. The Winter Royale matches will use the same game settings as the current Pop-Up Cup. As of Fortnite Update 6.30, which released last week, point totals are now factored into matchmaking, and bugs with point calculation have been addressed. Theres no word yet on just how many players will compete in the Finals, whether there will be just one lobby of 100 players for Europe and one lobby for North America, or if there will be several lobbies that will steadily get narrowed down.
